# CMOS Inverter Design and Analysis Using TSMC180nm

## Description

The motive of this project is to familiarize users with the LTspice tool and experiment with the working of a CMOS inverter, exploring various parameters associated with it. The project utilizes the TSMC180nm model file and begins by conducting an analysis of MOSFET models. The goal is to understand different plots and extract important parameters related to MOSFETs. Subsequently, the project progresses to the analysis of a CMOS inverter, where the aim is to obtain relevant plots and extract key parameters associated with its performance.
